Hi! I'm Anthony D'Alesandro, a software engineer from the Ohio State University, 
and I've been programming for 3 years. I am currently a senior at the Ohio State University
and I am looking to graduate cum laude.

On this website you can find my project porfolio and check out projects I have had the opportunity to contribute
to and some personal fun projects I have worked on. I am extremely disciplined and determined to become great at 
my craft. I am always learning a wide variety of skills for computer science and polishing my creations. Because of
this I have of course experimented with projects that wont be mentioned here...
